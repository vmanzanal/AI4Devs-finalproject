# Product Mission

## Pitch

SEPE Templates Comparator is a document analysis application that helps product architecture teams efficiently compare and track changes in SEPE PDF templates by providing automated comparison, cataloging, and mapping file management capabilities.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Product Architecture Teams**: Teams responsible for maintaining and updating SEPE template integrations
- **Document Management Teams**: Teams that need to track template changes and maintain mapping configurations

### User Personas

**Product Architect** (30-45 years old)
- **Role:** Senior Product Architect
- **Context:** Manages integration systems that depend on SEPE PDF templates and forms
- **Pain Points:** Manual template comparison is time-consuming, difficult to track changes over time, maintaining JSON mapping files is error-prone
- **Goals:** Automate template change detection, maintain accurate mapping files, reduce manual comparison work

**Integration Developer** (25-40 years old)  
- **Role:** Backend Developer
- **Context:** Implements and maintains systems that process SEPE forms and documents
- **Pain Points:** Template structure changes break integrations, difficult to identify specific field changes, manual mapping updates
- **Goals:** Quick identification of breaking changes, automated mapping updates, reliable change notifications

## The Problem

### Manual Template Comparison is Inefficient

Product teams currently spend significant time manually comparing SEPE PDF templates to identify structural changes, leading to delayed integration updates and potential system failures. This manual process is error-prone and doesn't scale with the frequency of template updates.

**Our Solution:** Automated PDF structure comparison with detailed change detection and historical tracking.

### Mapping File Maintenance is Error-Prone

Teams manually update JSON mapping files when template structures change, leading to inconsistencies and integration failures. There's no systematic way to validate mapping accuracy against current templates.

**Our Solution:** Automated mapping file generation and validation against current template structures.

### Change Detection is Reactive

Teams discover template changes only when integrations fail, rather than proactively monitoring for updates. This reactive approach leads to system downtime and emergency fixes.

**Our Solution:** Automated web scraping and proactive change notifications for new template versions.

## Differentiators

### AI-Powered Development Approach

Unlike traditional document management tools, we leverage AI assistance throughout the entire development process to accelerate feature delivery and maintain high code quality. This results in faster time-to-market and more robust solutions.

### PDF Structure Analysis Focus

Unlike generic document comparison tools, we specialize in AcroForm PDF analysis and provide detailed structural comparisons specifically designed for template integration workflows. This results in more accurate change detection and relevant insights.

### Automated Mapping Integration

Unlike manual mapping maintenance approaches, we provide automated JSON mapping file generation and validation directly integrated with the comparison workflow. This results in reduced errors and faster integration updates.

## Key Features

### Core Features

- **PDF Structure Comparison:** Detailed analysis of AcroForm field changes, additions, and removals between template versions
- **Template Cataloging:** Organized storage and versioning of template files with metadata and change history
- **Change History Tracking:** Complete audit trail of template modifications with timestamps and detailed change summaries
- **JSON Mapping Management:** Automated generation and updating of mapping files based on template structure analysis

### Automation Features

- **Web Scraping Integration:** Automated monitoring of SEPE website for new template versions and downloads
- **Change Notifications:** Proactive alerts when new template versions are detected or significant changes are identified
- **Batch Processing:** Ability to process multiple template comparisons and updates in automated workflows
- **Integration APIs:** RESTful APIs for connecting with existing development and deployment pipelines

### Collaboration Features

- **Team Dashboard:** Centralized view of all templates, recent changes, and team activity
- **Change Reviews:** Collaborative review workflow for template changes before mapping updates are applied
