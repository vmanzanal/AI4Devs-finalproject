# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement persistence layer for comparison results, enabling users to save analysis data, view comparison history in a paginated list, and retrieve saved comparisons for future reference. This includes database schema modifications to store complete comparison payloads (global metrics and field changes), backend API endpoints for ingestion and retrieval, and frontend UI for saving, listing, and viewing saved comparisons.
