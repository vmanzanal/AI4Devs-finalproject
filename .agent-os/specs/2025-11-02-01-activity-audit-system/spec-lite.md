# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement a database-backed activity audit system that tracks user actions (template uploads, comparison saves, registrations) and displays them on the homepage dashboard, replacing current mock data. The system will automatically log key events with timestamps and user attribution, providing transparency and traceability across the platform while excluding login events from the visible activity feed.
