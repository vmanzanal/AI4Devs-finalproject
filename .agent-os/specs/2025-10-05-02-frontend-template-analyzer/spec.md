> Spec: Frontend PDF Template Analyzer Component
> Created: 2025-10-05

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive frontend component for PDF template analysis that provides an intuitive drag-and-drop interface for file uploads and displays structured AcroForm field analysis results in a responsive table format. This component enables users to analyze SEPE PDF templates directly from the web interface, integrating seamlessly with the existing backend analysis API.

## User Stories

### PDF Upload and Analysis Interface

As a product architect, I want to upload PDF templates through a user-friendly web interface and immediately see the extracted form field structure, so that I can quickly understand template layouts without using external tools or API clients.

The interface should provide drag-and-drop functionality for PDF uploads, clear visual feedback during processing, and comprehensive display of all extracted fields with their properties and contextual information.

### Template Structure Visualization

As an integration developer, I want to view PDF form fields in a structured table format with clear field identifiers and contextual labels, so that I can easily identify field mappings and understand the template structure for integration purposes.

The table should display field IDs, types, nearby text labels, and available options in a scannable format that facilitates quick analysis and comparison between different template versions.

### Responsive Analysis Workflow

As a team member, I want to access the PDF analysis tool from any device and see results in a mobile-friendly format, so that I can analyze templates during meetings or while working remotely without being limited to desktop environments.

The component should provide responsive design that works on tablets and mobile devices, with proper touch interactions and optimized layouts for smaller screens.

## Spec Scope

1. **TemplateAnalyzePage Component** - Main page component with routing at /analyze, file upload interface, and result display coordination
2. **File Upload Interface** - Drag-and-drop zone with file validation, progress indicators, and error handling for PDF uploads
3. **TemplateFieldTable Component** - Responsive table component displaying analysis results with sorting and filtering capabilities
4. **TypeScript Interfaces** - Complete type definitions for API requests, responses, and component props with proper validation
5. **State Management** - React hooks-based state management for upload progress, analysis results, and error handling

## Out of Scope

- Authentication or user session management (component works without login)
- File storage or persistence beyond the analysis session
- Template comparison functionality (handled by separate components)
- Batch processing of multiple PDF files
- Export functionality for analysis results
- Advanced filtering or search within results

## Expected Deliverable

1. Complete TemplateAnalyzePage component with drag-and-drop PDF upload, API integration, and responsive result display
2. Reusable TemplateFieldTable component with proper TypeScript interfaces and accessibility features
3. Full TypeScript type definitions for API integration and component props with comprehensive error handling and loading states
