# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-10-05-pdf-template-analysis/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### API Endpoint Implementation

- Create POST /api/v1/templates/analyze endpoint in templates router with FastAPI UploadFile handling
- Configure endpoint as non-authenticated (open access) with proper CORS and error handling
- Implement file upload validation for PDF format and reasonable size limits (max 10MB)
- Return structured JSON response using Pydantic models with proper HTTP status codes
- Include comprehensive error handling for invalid files, processing failures, and malformed PDFs

### PDF Analysis Service

- Develop internal service using PyPDF2 and pdfplumber libraries for AcroForm field extraction
- Implement field ordering preservation based on document structure and field positioning
- Create text proximity detection algorithm to find closest text (left side), elements to each form field
- Support multiple field types: text, radiobutton, checkbox, listbox with type-specific metadata extraction
- Handle edge cases: empty forms, corrupted PDFs, non-AcroForm documents, and mixed field types

### Pydantic Models Structure

- Create TemplateField model with field_id (str), tipo (str), near_text (str), opciones_valores (List[str] | None)
- Implement response wrapper model for consistent API response formatting
- Add field validation for field IDs, types, and option values with appropriate constraints
- Include example values in model definitions for automatic OpenAPI documentation generation

### Document Processing Logic

- Preserve original field ordering from PDF document using coordinate-based sorting
- Extract field identifiers from PDF form field names or generate consistent IDs if missing
- Implement text proximity algorithm using coordinate distance calculations for nearest text detection
- Handle selection field options extraction for radio buttons, checkboxes, and dropdown lists

### Error Handling and Validation

- Validate uploaded files are valid PDF documents with AcroForm fields
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes: 200 for success, 400 for invalid files, 422 for validation errors
- Implement detailed error messages for debugging and client integration support
- Handle memory management for large PDF files and cleanup temporary resources

## External Dependencies

### PDF Processing Libraries

- **PyPDF2** - Primary library for PDF form field extraction and metadata reading
- **pdfplumber** - Secondary library for text extraction and coordinate-based text proximity analysis
- **Justification:** These libraries provide complementary capabilities for comprehensive PDF analysis, with PyPDF2 handling form fields and pdfplumber providing superior text extraction and positioning

### FastAPI Components

- **UploadFile** - FastAPI's file upload handling for multipart form data processing
- **HTTPException** - Structured error response handling with appropriate status codes
- **Justification:** Standard FastAPI components that align with existing application architecture and provide robust file handling capabilities
