# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: PDF Template Analysis API Endpoint
> Created: 2025-10-05

## Overview

Implement a transactional API endpoint that analyzes uploaded PDF templates and extracts AcroForm field structure in document order, providing detailed field metadata for integration mapping purposes. This endpoint enables real-time PDF structure analysis without persistent storage, supporting the core template comparison workflow.

## User Stories

### API Integration for Template Analysis

As a product architect, I want to upload a PDF template to an API endpoint and receive its complete field structure analysis, so that I can understand the template's form fields and their properties for integration mapping.

The API should accept a PDF file upload and return a structured JSON response containing all AcroForm fields in document order, including field IDs, types, nearby text context, and available options for selection fields.

### Development Team PDF Processing Support

As a backend developer, I want to have a dedicated service that handles PDF AcroForm analysis using PyPDF2 and pdfplumber libraries, so that I can integrate PDF structure extraction capabilities into other parts of the application.

The service should provide reliable field extraction, maintain document field ordering, and handle various PDF form field types (text, radio buttons, checkboxes, listboxes) with consistent output formatting.

### Template Structure Discovery

As an integration developer, I want to quickly analyze SEPE template structures through a simple API call, so that I can identify field changes and update mapping configurations without manual PDF inspection.

The endpoint should provide immediate analysis results with field identifiers, types, and contextual text to facilitate automated mapping file generation and template change detection.

## Spec Scope

1. **PDF Analysis API Endpoint** - POST /api/v1/templates/analyze endpoint with file upload capability and structured JSON response
2. **AcroForm Field Extraction Service** - Internal service using PyPDF2/pdfplumber for comprehensive PDF form field analysis
3. **Pydantic Response Models** - TemplateField model with field metadata and structured response formatting
4. **Document Order Preservation** - Maintain original field ordering from PDF document structure
5. **Field Type Detection** - Support for text, radiobutton, checkbox, and listbox field types with appropriate metadata

## Out of Scope

- Database persistence of analysis results or uploaded files
- Authentication or authorization requirements (endpoint is open)
- Batch processing of multiple PDF files
- Template comparison functionality (handled by existing endpoints)
- File storage or caching mechanisms
- Advanced PDF parsing beyond AcroForm fields

## Expected Deliverable

1. Fully functional POST /api/v1/templates/analyze endpoint that accepts PDF uploads and returns structured field analysis
2. Complete PDF analysis service with PyPDF2/pdfplumber integration for reliable field extraction and text proximity detection
3. Comprehensive Pydantic models for response formatting with proper field validation and type definitions
