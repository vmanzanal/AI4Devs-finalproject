# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: JWT Authentication System - Review & SOLID Compliance
> Created: 2025-10-19

## Overview

Review and document the existing JWT-based authentication system implementation, ensuring full compliance with SOLID principles (particularly Single Responsibility Principle), and verify that all required cryptographic and tokenization utilities are properly implemented using FastAPI, PyJWT, and passlib[bcrypt].

## User Stories

### Authentication System Review

As a **backend developer**, I want to have a well-documented and SOLID-compliant authentication system, so that the codebase is maintainable, testable, and follows industry best practices.

The authentication system should have clear separation of concerns with cryptographic operations (password hashing/verification), JWT token management (creation/validation), and authentication dependencies (user retrieval/validation) properly isolated in separate modules. This allows each component to be tested independently and modified without affecting other parts of the system.

### Secure User Registration and Login

As a **product architecture team member**, I want to register an account and securely log in to the SEPE Templates Comparator, so that I can access template comparison features while ensuring my credentials are protected.

The system should allow users to create accounts with email and password, hash passwords using bcrypt before storage, and provide JWT tokens upon successful authentication that can be used to access protected endpoints throughout the application.

### Token-Based API Access

As a **frontend developer**, I want to use JWT tokens to authenticate API requests, so that users remain authenticated across multiple requests without repeatedly sending credentials.

After successful login, the frontend receives a JWT token with configurable expiration time that can be included in subsequent API requests. The backend validates these tokens and retrieves the associated user information, rejecting invalid or expired tokens with appropriate HTTP status codes.

## Spec Scope

1. **Core Security Utilities** - Review and document cryptographic functions (password hashing with bcrypt, password verification) in `app/core/security.py`
2. **JWT Token Management** - Review and document token creation, signing, verification, and expiration handling using PyJWT
3. **Authentication Dependencies** - Review and document FastAPI dependency functions for user retrieval and validation (`get_current_user`, `get_current_active_user`)
4. **Authentication Endpoints** - Review and document user registration, login (both standard and OAuth2-compatible), and password management endpoints
5. **Service Layer Compliance** - Verify if service layer functions exist for user management (create user, get user by email) and implement if missing
6. **SOLID Principle Compliance** - Ensure Single Responsibility Principle is followed across all authentication modules
7. **Configuration Management** - Review JWT configuration settings (secret key, algorithm, expiration hours) in `app/core/config.py`
8. **Pydantic Schema Validation** - Review and document all authentication-related Pydantic schemas for input validation and response formatting

## Out of Scope

- OAuth2 integration with external providers (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- Two-factor authentication (2FA) or multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Session management with refresh tokens
- Rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- Email verification for new user registrations
- Advanced password policies (complexity requirements, expiration)
- Account lockout mechanisms after failed login attempts
- Audit logging of authentication events
- Integration tests for the authentication system (only architectural review)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Complete architectural documentation** of the existing JWT authentication system with clear module responsibilities and data flow diagrams
2. **Verification report** confirming SOLID compliance or identifying specific refactoring recommendations
3. **Missing service layer functions** implemented (if any) following the Single Responsibility Principle
4. **Updated code comments and docstrings** ensuring all authentication functions are properly documented with type hints
5. **Browser-testable authentication flow** including user registration via POST `/api/v1/auth/register`, login via POST `/api/v1/auth/login`, and accessing a protected endpoint with the returned JWT token
