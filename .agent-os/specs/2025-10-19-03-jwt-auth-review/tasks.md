## Tasks

- [x] 1. Create User Service Layer (Core Implementation)

  - [x] 1.1 Write unit tests for user service functions
  - [x] 1.2 Create `app/services/user_service.py` with module docstring and imports
  - [x] 1.3 Implement `get_user_by_email(db, email)` function with type hints and docstring
  - [x] 1.4 Implement `create_user(db, user_data)` function with password hashing
  - [x] 1.5 Implement `get_user_by_id(db, user_id)` helper function
  - [x] 1.6 Implement `authenticate_user(db, email, password)` function
  - [x] 1.7 Update `app/services/__init__.py` to export user_service module
  - [x] 1.8 Run unit tests and verify all pass with 80%+ coverage

- [x] 2. Refactor Authentication Endpoints to Use Service Layer

  - [x] 2.1 Write integration tests for refactored auth endpoints
  - [x] 2.2 Refactor `POST /auth/register` endpoint to use `user_service.get_user_by_email()` and `user_service.create_user()`
  - [x] 2.3 Refactor `POST /auth/login` endpoint to use `user_service.authenticate_user()`
  - [x] 2.4 Refactor `POST /auth/password-reset` endpoint to use `user_service.get_user_by_email()`
  - [x] 2.5 Refactor `POST /auth/password-reset/confirm` endpoint to use `user_service.get_user_by_email()`
  - [x] 2.6 Verify no direct database queries remain in auth endpoints
  - [x] 2.7 Run all existing tests to ensure no regressions
  - [x] 2.8 Run integration tests and verify all pass

- [x] 3. Update Documentation and Code Comments

  - [x] 3.1 Review and enhance docstrings in `app/core/security.py`
  - [x] 3.2 Review and enhance docstrings in `app/core/auth.py`
  - [x] 3.3 Review and enhance docstrings in `app/api/v1/endpoints/auth.py`
  - [x] 3.4 Verify all functions have complete type hints (parameters and return types)
  - [x] 3.5 Add inline comments for complex logic where needed
  - [x] 3.6 Update any outdated comments after refactoring
  - [x] 3.7 Verify OpenAPI/Swagger documentation is accurate

- [x] 4. Manual Testing and Verification

  - [x] 4.1 Start backend server and verify no startup errors
  - [x] 4.2 Test user registration via Swagger UI at `/docs`
  - [x] 4.3 Test user login and verify JWT token is returned
  - [x] 4.4 Test accessing protected endpoint `/auth/me` with token
  - [x] 4.5 Test password change functionality with valid credentials
  - [x] 4.6 Test error scenarios (invalid credentials, duplicate email, invalid token)
  - [x] 4.7 Verify all endpoints return appropriate HTTP status codes
  - [x] 4.8 Document any issues found and verify fixes

- [x] 5. SOLID Compliance Review and Final Verification
  - [x] 5.1 Review service layer for Single Responsibility Principle compliance
  - [x] 5.2 Verify endpoints only handle HTTP concerns (no business logic)
  - [x] 5.3 Verify security module only handles cryptographic operations
  - [x] 5.4 Verify auth dependencies only handle user validation
  - [x] 5.5 Run complete test suite and verify 80%+ coverage
  - [x] 5.6 Review architecture against SOLID principles checklist
  - [x] 5.7 Update spec documentation with final architecture status
  - [x] 5.8 Generate SOLID compliance report (target: 8.6/10)

## Task Execution Notes

### Dependencies

- Task 2 depends on Task 1 (service layer must exist before refactoring endpoints)
- Task 3 can be done in parallel with Task 2 if needed
- Task 4 depends on Task 2 (endpoints must be refactored before manual testing)
- Task 5 depends on all previous tasks

### Testing Approach

- Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) where feasible
- Write tests first for new service layer (Task 1.1)
- Write integration tests before refactoring endpoints (Task 2.1)
- Verify existing tests still pass after each refactoring step

### Success Criteria

- ✅ Service layer implemented with 4 required functions
- ✅ All authentication endpoints refactored to use service layer
- ✅ No direct database queries in endpoint handlers
- ✅ All functions have complete docstrings and type hints
- ✅ Unit test coverage ≥ 80% for service layer
- ✅ All integration tests pass
- ✅ Manual testing successful for all user stories
- ✅ SOLID compliance rating improved from 7.2/10 to 8.6/10

### Estimated Effort

- Task 1: 2-4 hours (core implementation)
- Task 2: 2-3 hours (refactoring)
- Task 3: 1-2 hours (documentation)
- Task 4: 1 hour (manual testing)
- Task 5: 1 hour (compliance review)

**Total: 7-11 hours**
