# Upload Template Flow Refactoring

## Overview

Refactor the template upload flow to integrate the analysis page into the main navigation and create a success confirmation page after template ingestion. This will improve UX by providing a clear flow: Upload → Analyze → Save → Success with proper navigation and feedback.

## User Stories

### US-1: Integrated Template Upload Navigation

**As a** user  
**I want** the "Upload Template" menu option to show the analysis page with navigation  
**So that** I can easily access other parts of the app while uploading templates

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The `/analyze` route is now a protected route with the main layout (sidebar/navigation)
- "Upload Template" menu item navigates to `/analyze`
- The analyze page shows the app navigation menu
- Users can navigate to other sections while on the analyze page

### US-2: Template Creation Success Page

**As a** user  
**I want** to see a confirmation page after successfully creating a template  
**So that** I can verify the template was saved correctly and access its details

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- After successful template ingestion, user is redirected to `/templates/created/:versionId`
- Success page displays:
  - Success message with checkmark icon
  - Template name and current version
  - Template metadata (author, title, subject, etc.)
  - Version metadata (creation date, page count, field count, file size)
  - Download PDF button
  - "View Template" button to go to template details
  - "Upload Another" button to start a new upload
- All data is fetched from the new backend endpoint

### US-3: Get Template Version by ID

**As a** developer  
**I want** an API endpoint to fetch a specific template version by its ID  
**So that** the success page can display complete version information

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- New endpoint: `GET /api/v1/templates/versions/{versionId}`
- Returns complete version data including file information
- Returns associated template information
- Requires authentication
- Returns 404 if version not found
- Returns 403 if user doesn't have access

## Spec Scope

### In Scope

- Refactor App.tsx routing to integrate `/analyze` with layout
- Update navigation menu to link "Upload Template" to `/analyze`
- Modify TemplateAnalyzePage to redirect to success page after save
- Create new TemplateCreatedPage component
- Implement backend endpoint `GET /api/v1/templates/versions/{versionId}`
- Add tests for new endpoint and component
- Update frontend types for version detail response

### Out of Scope

- Modifying the PDF analysis logic itself
- Changing the template ingestion endpoint
- Adding version comparison features
- Implementing template editing functionality
- Multi-file upload support

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Backend:**

   - New endpoint: `GET /api/v1/templates/versions/{versionId}` with full version details
   - Response schema for version detail view
   - Unit tests for the new endpoint
