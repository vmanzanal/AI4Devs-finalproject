# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement a comprehensive Template Management interface with a sortable, filterable table displaying all uploaded SEPE PDF templates, enabling administrators to download template files, view complete version history with metadata, and inspect detailed AcroForm field information through modal dialogs. This feature builds upon existing `/templates` route and `/api/v1/templates/` endpoint to create the primary interface for template exploration and management.
