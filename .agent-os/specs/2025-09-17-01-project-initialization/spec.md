# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Project Initialization and Technical Documentation
> Created: 2025-09-17

## Overview

Initialize the complete project structure and technical documentation for the SEPE Templates Comparator application, establishing the foundation for rapid development with proper configuration, tooling, and documentation to support the AI-assisted development methodology.

## User Stories

### Development Team Setup

As a product architect, I want to have a properly initialized project structure, so that the development team can immediately start building features without spending time on basic setup and configuration.

The project structure should include separate backend and frontend directories, proper dependency management, development tooling configuration, and clear documentation that guides developers through the setup process and development workflow.

### AI-Assisted Development Foundation

As a technical lead, I want to have comprehensive technical documentation and standardized project structure, so that AI assistants can effectively understand the project context and generate consistent, high-quality code.

The documentation should include API specifications, database schemas, development guidelines, and architectural decisions that enable AI tools to make informed decisions when generating code and following project conventions.

### Development Environment Consistency

As a developer, I want to have a consistent development environment setup, so that I can focus on feature development rather than configuration issues and environment inconsistencies.

The setup should include containerized development environment, automated dependency installation, code formatting and linting tools, and testing framework configuration that works consistently across different developer machines.

## Spec Scope

1. **Backend Project Structure** - Complete Python/FastAPI project structure with proper module organization and configuration files
2. **Frontend Project Structure** - React/Vite application structure with TypeScript configuration and component organization
3. **Development Environment** - Docker configuration, virtual environment setup, and development tooling integration
4. **Technical Documentation** - API documentation templates, development guides, and architectural decision records
5. **Testing Framework Setup** - Backend testing with pytest and frontend testing with React Testing Library configuration

## Out of Scope

- Actual feature implementation (PDF processing, comparison logic)
- Production deployment configuration and infrastructure setup
- Database data seeding and migration scripts
- Third-party service integrations (Azure services configuration)
- Performance optimization and monitoring setup

## Expected Deliverable

1. Complete project directory structure with backend and frontend applications properly configured and ready for development
2. All necessary configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt, Docker files) with proper dependencies and development tools
3. Comprehensive technical documentation including development setup guide, API documentation templates, and coding standards integration
