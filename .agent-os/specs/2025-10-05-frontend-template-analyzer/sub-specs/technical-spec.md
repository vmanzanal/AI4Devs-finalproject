# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-10-05-frontend-template-analyzer/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Component Architecture

- Create TemplateAnalyzePage as main route component using React Router at `/analyze` path
- Implement modular component structure with TemplateFieldTable as separate reusable component
- Use React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback) for state management and side effects
- Follow React TypeScript best practices with proper prop interfaces and type safety
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states for robust user experience

### File Upload Implementation

- Create drag-and-drop zone using native HTML5 drag and drop API with proper event handling
- Implement file validation for PDF format (.pdf extension) and size limits (10MB maximum)
- Add visual feedback for drag states (drag-over, drag-enter, drag-leave) using TailwindCSS classes
- Include fallback file input button for users who prefer traditional file selection
- Provide clear error messages for invalid files with user-friendly language and recovery suggestions

### API Integration

- Use fetch API or Axios (if already configured) for HTTP requests to POST /api/v1/templates/analyze
- Implement multipart/form-data request formatting for file uploads with proper headers
- Handle API response processing with proper error handling for network failures and server errors
- Add request timeout handling and retry logic for improved reliability
- Implement proper loading states with progress indicators during API calls

### UI/UX Design with TailwindCSS

- Create responsive layout using TailwindCSS grid and flexbox utilities for mobile-first design
- Implement accessible color scheme with proper contrast ratios and dark mode support
- Use consistent spacing and typography following TailwindCSS design system
- Add smooth transitions and animations for state changes using TailwindCSS transition utilities
- Ensure proper focus management and keyboard navigation for accessibility compliance

### Table Component Specifications

- Create TemplateFieldTable component with responsive design using TailwindCSS table utilities
- Implement column headers: Field ID, Type, Nearest Label, Options with proper sorting capabilities
- Handle null/undefined value_options display with "N/A" or "â€”" placeholder text
- Add row hover effects and zebra striping for improved readability
- Include mobile-responsive design with horizontal scroll or card layout for small screens

## External Dependencies

### React Router Integration

- **React Router v6** - For client-side routing and navigation to /analyze route
- **Justification:** Standard routing solution for React applications that integrates with existing application routing structure

### HTTP Client Library

- **Axios** (if already configured) or **Fetch API** - For API communication with backend
- **Justification:** Axios provides request/response interceptors and better error handling, while Fetch API is native and requires no additional dependencies

### File Handling Utilities

- **React Dropzone** (optional enhancement) - Enhanced drag-and-drop functionality with better browser compatibility
- **Justification:** Provides more robust file handling and better user experience across different browsers and devices

### Icon Library Integration

- **Lucide React** - For upload icons, loading spinners, and table action icons as specified in tech stack
- **Justification:** Consistent with project tech stack and provides comprehensive icon set for UI elements
