# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement a version ingestion workflow with a dedicated endpoint (`POST /api/v1/templates/ingest/version`) that allows users to upload new versions of existing templates following the Single Responsibility Principle. The frontend will provide clear UI distinction between creating new templates and adding versions, with a modal for template selection and version details input. This enables proper version history tracking and comparison of template evolution over time.
