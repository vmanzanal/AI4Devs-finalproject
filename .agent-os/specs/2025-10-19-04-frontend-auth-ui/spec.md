> Spec: Frontend Authentication UI System
> Created: 2025-10-19

## Overview

Implement a complete, production-ready authentication UI layer for the SEPE Templates Comparator frontend that seamlessly integrates with the existing JWT-based backend API (rating 8.8/10), starting with a fully-featured Login Page as the primary deliverable, followed by Registration, Password Reset flows, and comprehensive JWT token management using React 19, TypeScript, and the project's established frontend architecture.

## User Stories

### User Login

As a **SEPE Templates Comparator user**, I want to log in with my email and password through an intuitive, accessible form, so that I can securely access the template comparison features.

The user navigates to `/login`, enters their email and password, and submits the form. The system validates inputs client-side (proper email format, minimum password length), displays loading state during authentication, stores the JWT token upon success, and redirects to the intended destination (or dashboard). If authentication fails, clear error messages are displayed without exposing security details. The form supports keyboard navigation, screen readers, and dark mode.

### User Registration

As a **new user**, I want to register for an account with email, password, and optional full name, so that I can start using the SEPE Templates Comparator.

The user navigates to `/register`, completes the registration form with email, password (with confirmation), and optional full name. Client-side validation ensures password strength, email format, and matching password confirmation. Upon successful registration, the user is automatically logged in and redirected to the dashboard. The form provides real-time validation feedback and accessibility features.

### Password Recovery

As a **user who forgot my password**, I want to request a password reset via email and set a new password using a secure token, so that I can regain access to my account without contacting support.

The user clicks "Forgot Password?" on the login page, enters their email address, and receives a reset token via email (backend handles email sending). The user clicks the emailed link containing the reset token, which directs them to `/password-reset/confirm?token=xxx`, where they enter and confirm a new password. Upon success, they're redirected to login with a success message.

### Persistent Authentication

As a **returning user**, I want to remain logged in across browser sessions and have my session automatically refreshed, so that I don't need to log in repeatedly.

When the user logs in, their JWT token is stored in `localStorage`. On subsequent visits, the `AuthContext` automatically validates the token by calling `/auth/me`. If the token is valid, the user is authenticated. If the token expires or becomes invalid (401 response), the user is automatically logged out and redirected to login. The system provides a seamless experience without disruptive re-authentication unless necessary.

## Spec Scope

1. **Login Page (`/login`)** - Full-featured form with email/password inputs, validation, loading states, error handling, "Forgot Password?" link, "Sign Up" link, and dark mode support
2. **Registration Page (`/register`)** - Complete registration form with email, password (with confirmation), optional full name, client-side validation, auto-login on success, and link to login page
3. **Password Reset Request (`/password-reset`)** - Simple form to request password reset via email with user feedback
4. **Password Reset Confirmation (`/password-reset/confirm`)** - Form to set new password using token from URL query parameter with validation
5. **JWT Token Management** - Automatic token storage, retrieval, and injection into API requests via existing `apiService` interceptors
6. **Authentication State Management** - Enhance existing `AuthContext` to integrate login/register/logout functionality with UI components
7. **Protected Route Handling** - Existing `ProtectedRoute` component already implemented, verify integration
8. **Form Validation & UX** - Real-time validation, accessible error messages, loading spinners, success/error notifications, and smooth transitions
9. **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first approach using Tailwind CSS, optimized for all screen sizes
10. **Accessibility (a11y)** - Full keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, screen reader support, focus management, and WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
11. **Dark Mode Support** - Utilize existing `ThemeContext` for consistent theming across auth forms
12. **Error Handling** - Graceful error messages, automatic logout on 401, and network error recovery

## Out of Scope

- OAuth2 social login integration (Google, GitHub, Facebook)
- Two-factor authentication (2FA) or multi-factor authentication (MFA) UI
- Email verification flow (though backend endpoints exist)
- "Remember Me" checkbox functionality (will use default token expiration)
- Account profile management UI (separate feature)
- Change password UI within user settings (will be addressed in profile management spec)
- Refresh token rotation mechanism (backend uses single JWT token)
- Session timeout warnings or countdown timers
- Login rate limiting UI indicators
- Biometric authentication
- Password strength meter visual indicator (basic validation only)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Fully functional Login Page** accessible at `/login` with email/password form, validation, loading states, error handling, and successful authentication flow that stores JWT token and redirects users
2. **Registration Page** at `/register` with complete form, validation, auto-login after registration, and seamless user experience
3. **Password Reset Flow** including request page (`/password-reset`) and confirmation page (`/password-reset/confirm`) with token handling
4. **Enhanced AuthContext** with integrated login, register, and logout functions that work with UI components
5. **Comprehensive Form Components** including reusable input fields, error displays, submit buttons, and loading indicators following project component standards
6. **Unit and Integration Tests** using Vitest and React Testing Library for all authentication components with >80% coverage
7. **Accessibility Compliance** verified with axe-core and manual keyboard navigation testing
8. **Documentation** including component usage examples, integration guide, and troubleshooting section
9. **Browser-testable authentication** where users can register a new account, log in, access protected routes, log out, and request password reset through the UI
