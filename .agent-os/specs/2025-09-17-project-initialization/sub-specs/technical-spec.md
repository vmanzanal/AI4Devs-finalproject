# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-17-project-initialization/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Backend Structure (Python/FastAPI)
- Create modular directory structure following Python best practices with separate modules for models, services, API routes, and utilities
- Configure FastAPI application with proper CORS, middleware, and error handling setup
- Set up SQLAlchemy with proper model base classes and database connection configuration
- Include development dependencies: pytest, black, isort, mypy, pre-commit hooks
- Configure environment variable management with python-dotenv for different environments (development, testing, production)

### Frontend Structure (React/Vite)
- Initialize Vite-based React application with TypeScript configuration and proper build optimization
- Set up component directory structure with shared components, pages, hooks, and utilities organization
- Configure TailwindCSS with custom design system and responsive breakpoints as specified in tech-stack.md
- Include development dependencies: ESLint, Prettier, React Testing Library, TypeScript strict configuration
- Set up routing structure with React Router and state management foundation with Context API

### Development Environment
- Create Docker Compose configuration for local development with PostgreSQL database, backend, and frontend services
- Set up Python virtual environment with requirements.txt and requirements-dev.txt separation
- Configure package.json scripts for development, testing, building, and linting workflows
- Include VS Code workspace configuration with recommended extensions and settings for Python and React development
- Set up pre-commit hooks for code formatting, linting, and basic validation

### Documentation Structure
- Create API documentation templates using FastAPI's automatic OpenAPI generation
- Set up development setup guide with step-by-step instructions for environment configuration
- Include coding standards integration referencing .agent-os/standards/ files
- Create architectural decision record (ADR) template for documenting technical decisions
- Set up README files for both backend and frontend with clear setup and development instructions

### Testing Framework Configuration
- Configure pytest for backend with proper test directory structure, fixtures, and database testing setup
- Set up React Testing Library with Jest configuration for frontend component and integration testing
- Include test coverage reporting and minimum coverage thresholds
- Configure continuous integration preparation with test scripts and validation workflows
- Set up testing utilities and helpers for common testing patterns in both backend and frontend

## External Dependencies
