# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement a template ingestion system that allows authenticated users to persist analyzed PDF templates with their extracted field data into the database, following SOLID principles by separating ingestion logic from CRUD operations. The system handles file storage, PDF analysis orchestration, and transactional persistence of templates with full field-level detail. Users analyze PDFs on the frontend, then save them via a "Guardar como Versi√≥n Inicial" button that captures metadata and calls a new authenticated `/api/v1/templates/ingest` endpoint.
